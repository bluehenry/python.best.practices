# Python Virtual Environment Tools
## virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper
* Recommend


## Andconda's conda
* Package, dependency and environment management for any languageâ€”Python, R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, FORTRAN, and more

## pyenv
* Simple Python Version Management
* There is a pyenv plugin named pyenv-virtualenv which comes with various features to help pyenv users to manage virtual environments created by virtualenv or Anaconda

## poetry
* Dependency Management for Python
* poetry will also detect if you are inside a virtualenv and install the packages accordingly. So, poetry can be installed globally and used everywhere.

## pipenv
* Don't recommend. 
* Since pipenv doesn't seem to be further developed

## pew 
* Don't recommend
* The main problem that I noticed is that its support is very limited now. The last commit on the code is from March 2018, which is almost a year old.
