# The yield statement suspends functionâ€™s execution and sends a value back to caller,
# but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed,
# the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run.
# This allows its code to produce a series of values over time,
# rather them computing them at once and sending them back like a list.
