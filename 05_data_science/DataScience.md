# Data Science

## Numpy
[Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
* a powerful N-dimensional array object
* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

## Pandas
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.
